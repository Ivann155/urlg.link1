# ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Copy Files to Your Project

Copy these files from the `deployment-files` folder to your main project folder:

```
deployment-files/
â”œâ”€â”€ wsgi.py           â†’ Copy to your project root
â”œâ”€â”€ Procfile          â†’ Copy to your project root  
â”œâ”€â”€ runtime.txt       â†’ Copy to your project root
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt  â†’ Replace your existing requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py           â†’ Replace your existing app.py
â””â”€â”€ README.md        â†’ Copy to your project root (optional)
```

## Step 2: Install New Dependencies

Run this command in your project folder:
```bash
pip install flask-cors gunicorn
```

## Step 3: Test Locally

Test that everything works:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Step 4: Deploy!

### Heroku:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push heroku main
```

### Railway:
- Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
- Deploy with one click

### Render:
- Connect your GitHub repo to Render
- Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set start command: `gunicorn wsgi:app`

## âœ… That's it! Your app will now work when uploaded.

## Troubleshooting

If you get errors:
1. Make sure all files are copied to the root of your project
2. Check that `flask-cors` and `gunicorn` are installed
3. Verify your `app.py` has the production configuration
4. Test the `/health` endpoint locally first
